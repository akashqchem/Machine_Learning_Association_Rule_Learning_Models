This repository contains a simple implementation of the Apriori algorithm for Market Basket Optimization. The project uses transaction data to uncover associations between items that tend to appear together in customer purchases, without relying on any target labels. The model is implemented using the apyori library in Python. To keep only meaningful and reliable rules, the Apriori algorithm was run using a minimum support of 0.003, a minimum confidence of 0.2, and a minimum lift of 3, while restricting the rule length to exactly two items by setting both min\_length and max\_length to 2. These parameter choices ensure that discovered patterns are frequent enough, strong enough, and statistically significant. The final output consists of association rules that reveal item combinations commonly purchased together, which can be useful for product placement, bundling strategies, or recommendation systems.
