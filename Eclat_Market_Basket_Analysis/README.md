This project applies the Eclat-style Association Rule Learning approach to the classic Market Basket Optimisation dataset in order to find frequent item combinations that appear together in customer transactions. The dataset is first converted into a list of transactions (each row represents one shopping basket), and the rules are generated using the same threshold settings as the Apriori model: a minimum support of 0.003, a minimum confidence of 0.2, a minimum lift of 3, and a rule length between 2 and 2 items. The final results are then sorted in descending order of support to highlight the most frequently occurring item pairs. This repository serves as a self-practice implementation of Eclat-style frequent itemset mining in Python, parallel to the Apriori-based Market Basket Optimisation project, and can be reused as a template for future datasets with similar structure.
